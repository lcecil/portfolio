The solution was a tool that would allow customers to go into a Target store for in-person device troubleshooting, thereby reducing call volume and duration for our users.",

Preliminary testing of a current interface can help designers understand user pain points and areas of interest, whereas post-release testing monitors whether design implementations were successful. Paper prototyping is my favorite method for gathering iterative feedback during the design lifecycle and avoiding major pitfalls.",
          "Personas are a great tool for getting a team on the same page about who is using the products they are creating. The key to a successful persona is not the physical profile itself, but its adoption from all stakeholders involved and application by a company. I work closely with clients, product owners, developers, and most importantly, end users, to ensure that the personas produced are accurate and useful.",
          "The wrong label can make or break a design. Luckily, a quick card sort is one of the simplest ways to evaluate whether the terms used in a design are terms your users can understand. I use this research method often, either internally or with my end users, to test whether a grouping of information is logical beyond my own assumptions and biases.",
          "Surveys help establish both quantitative and qualitative data as a base line before beginning a project, or alternatively, assess whether a design implementation was successful. I find that the key to crafting a useful and accurate survey is to narrow the scope so that the questions are specific and focused on a portion of the product. This reduces the margin for error due to generalities or ambiguity in the survey responses.",
          "If the opportunity to have face-to-face time with an end user is available, it can be the most valuable time spent on a project. As a designer, the desire to empathize with my users can only go so far without observing their daily tasks or hearing stories of their struggles with a product. The art of asking questions is a skill I strive to perfect and often helps me answer the “why” when looking at quantitative data or metrics. "
